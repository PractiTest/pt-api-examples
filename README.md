# pt-api-examples

Each of PractiTest API methods are any of the following HTTP requests: GET,POST, PUT and DELETE.

In the <a href="https://www.practitest.com/api-v2/" target="_blank">PractiTest API V2</a> documentation, there are curl examples for each method (with one of the request types). If the curl begins with GET, you need to see the get_request file in your language. The same with the rest of the method types.
